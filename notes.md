# Jasmine - Getting Familiar

First things first: `gem install jasmine`.

To initialize a Jasmine testing thingy, run `jasmine init`.

Your main Javascript files go under `public/javascripts/app_files'.

The specs to match your main javascript files go under 'spec/javascripts/app_files'.

Lib and spec names follow a pattern - "LibraryName" => "LibraryNameSpec". If a lib is called "Player.js", then the spec must be called "PlayerSpec.js".
